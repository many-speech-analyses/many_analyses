Analyses
================
Last update: 2023-01-18

The `analyses` directory contains all of the analytic teams’ data
(downloaded from OSF). The teams’ analyses were refit by the initiating
authors (sc, jvc, and tr) and the corresponding rds files are stored in
the `models` directory. The file `msa_mean_sd_df.csv` contains the
unstandardized mean and standard deviations of every submitted model
containing pitch, duration or intensity as the outcome measure. Finally,
`msa_models.rds` contains the coding sheet completed by the initiating
authors of every submitted analysis.
