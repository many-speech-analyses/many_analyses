However, at some points a bit more explanation or supporting sources could be added as to why these predictors were chosen (f.e., gender).

That won't change the results bit might slightly change the values, particularly the estimate.",The chosen of statistical analysis is good and appropriate for the type of data.,"As mentioned before, it might be good to add some brief notes of why the authors had decided upon controlling for gender (maybe some past literature).",The variables seem all very suitably chosen for the model.,The statistical models are structured well.,NA,"As per my note above, possibly consider changing the contrast type, for the sake of presentation of the final statistics numbers.",NA,2
clione_dorsalis,40,60,60,publishable with major revision.,"The authors were interested in possible differences in duration and vowel space measurements as conditioned by typicality condition. They ran three sets of models (which required extra work to evaluate), one examining duration of the full color word. The second set respectively examined Vowel Space Area, and the third set examined F1 and F2 at different points. This results in several total models, each with their own set of limitations. As we describe below, the choice to use linear mixed effects regression models was fine, as were the questions related to vowel formants/space and duration as conditioned by typicality. However, we have a number of concerns related to data measurement and analysis. First, vowel boundaries should not have been done by hand, as it is an unreliable method. A forced-aligner would have been more useful and saved the authors significant time. The duration models use the entire word, causing problems related to the lack of control of non-stressed vowels and consonants, which makes it difficult to ascertain the true effects of stressed vowel length. Finally, comparing data from 30 different speakers without doing any sort of vowel normalization to control for vocal tract length differences by speaker, and including random effects of speaker does not address this limitation since the effect is not random. In short, our main concerns had to do with the variables: the lack of vowel normalization and the selection of model variables (detailed below).","The use of linear mixed effects regressions for duration, VSA, and F1/F2 data is appropriate for attempting to understand whether the categorical variable of interest (typicality) alongside other categorical variables (gender, vowel identity) had an effect on the dependent continuous variables of word duration, VSA, and F1/F2.","In all models, the variable of interest (typicality) is included as an independent variable; this is appropriate.

In the model of duration, the researchers chose to model word duration as the dependent variable, even though their questions suggested that they were most interested in vowel duration. Indeed, they say that they only measured word duration because of slippery issues of segmentation for vowels with a neighboring sonorant. While word duration is in principle comparable across conditions (given that the same words are used in all conditions), there is an issue that the words each have different properties. To some extent, it seems the researchers attempted to control for this by including the identity of the stressed vowels as a variable (given different inherent vowel lengths), but problematically each word also had its own unique set of other segments with their own inherent lengths. This would have been an issue that could have been avoided had the dependent variable been vowel length instead of word length. To achieve this, the researchers could have used forced-aligner software (so that there would have been stable principles for identifying phone boundaries, even in the context of sonorants) to allow vowel duration to be directly measured (rather than indirectly measured through word duration).  Still in the duration model, it is unclear why gender is included in the model: are there previously identified effects of gender on issues related to duration? If not, it seems like an extraneous variable that should not be included. Lastly, the filename (which appears to be a stand-in for speaker) is included as a random effect; this is appropriate for this measure. What is missing in this model, however, is the inclusion of an independent variable that maps onto word identity (given that this is a measure of word length).

For the model of vowel space area, there are no variables considered besides typicality and speaker as a random effect. First, it seems to us that speaker should not be a random effect: different speakers have different physical sizes which has a non-random effect on vocal-tract length (and thereby vowel space area). Instead, the researchers ought to have included some variable(s) that get at the physical size of the speaker. One measure they could have included is an induced vocal tract length measure (e.g., by running measures on a schwa vowel). Similarly, since VSA depends on vocal tract lengths which (in most, but not all) cluster according to gender, this model would be one where inclusion of gender would be appropriate. (This appears to be something the researchers knew to do, given the inclusion of gender in the F1/F2 models, but they may have forgotten that their VSA measures depend on F1/F2 measures.)

Finally, for the four F1/F2 models (F1 at the 2nd measure, F1 at the 4th measure, F2 at the 2nd measure, F2 at the 4th measure), the dependent variables were F1 measures or F2 measures (in raw Hz), and the independent variables were typicality, vowel identity, and gender, with filename (speaker) as a random effect. The choice of vowel identity is a good one. Similarly, gender is a well-selected variable, for reasons discussed above for the VSA model. However, as with the VSA model, it may have been appropriate to include a measure of vocal tract length (or to have normalized the F1/F2 measures, as described below) so as to better model the relevant factor (i.e. directly, without gender as a proxy for both body size and socialization). Finally, speaker should not have been used as a random effect (for the same reasons as those described for the VSA model).
","The model examining duration has several limitations. First, the choice to hand-measure the vowels and then only include duration of the entire word introduces a lot of variability into the results. The authors should have force-aligned the data so that they would have consistent vowel measures. They could have then excluded vowels in the environment of sonorants, or included that as a variable in their model. The inclusion of only stressed vowel as a fixed effect in the model masks the possible effects of the durations of other vowels in the same word, which is the chief issue with testing the duration of the entire word. Additionally, there is no justification given for including gender in this duration model, and no hypothesis for why duration might differ by gender. 

The models for F1 and F2 are unusual in that they examined timepoints 2,4, and 5, without motivating the choice of those points, or including the effects of preceding and following phonological context. (e.g., we expect F2 effects for a vowel followed by [t] to be different from the F2 effects for a vowel followed by [k]; this model did not account for that.). The biggest issue with these models however, is the lack of any sort of normalization. With 30 speakers of two genders, there is massive variation in vocal tract size, which the authors acknowledge in their comment about gender. As a result, direct comparisons between non-normalized Hz values for different speakers are not appropriate, as they may mask these predictable physiological differences between speakers. The inclusion of speaker as a random effect does not solve this problem, as speaker is not a truly random effect for non-normalized data. 

The models examining Vowel Space Area also have several limitations, similar to those for the F1 and F2 models. The authors have data from 30 speakers, in 3 typicality conditions, at two time points, leading to 180 VSA observations. However, again, there is no normalization for speaker, leading to the types of issues discussed above for the F1 and F2 models. VSA is essentially based on a combination of F1 and F2 values, so speakers with a smaller vocal tract, for example, would be more likely to have a smaller VSA compared to speakers with larger ones. This model also does not include gender, though it is likely to be predictor as well and was included in the F1 and F2 models. A priori vowel normalization would have addressed several of these issues. 
","The authors include 7 models in their analyses, all of which are linear mixed effects regression. This is an appropriate choice of model type for their analyses. However the models have several limitations. As discussed above, the inclusion and exclusion of gender for some models and not others, without clear hypotheses, is not appropriate. The fact that the duration model includes gender is bizarre. This model should also have a random effect of both word identity in addition to filename (which here is a stand-in for speaker). The vowel models should not include speaker as a random effect, for the reasons discussed above.","The authors excluded observations labeled NA for typicality, which is appropriate given that that they were evaluating the effects of typicality",We think the authors should have normalized for F1 and F2 to control for physical characteristics of speakers (and constraints on how much variability each speaker can physically produce in vowels space).,"The authors may want to consider focus condition along with typicality, as we expect that focus would also influence vowel space and hyperarticulation (not to mention vowel duration).
The R has some errors (likely due to changing variable names) – we suggest that the researchers re-run the R from scratch in an empty R environment to debug to ensure that the code can be run successively line-by-line without error.

clione_dorsalis,85,53,65,publishable with major revision.,"While the phonetic analyses seem to have been competently carried out, there are many issues with the statistical analyses that could have affected the results. I also found that there wasn't sufficient justification for the specific model structures, or, indeed some of the key outcome variables (such as F1/F2, which are only mentioned in the context of vowel spaces in the intro, but then suddenly make an appearance in the analyses at the end). Also, far too many analyses were run here to be able to confidently point to one of them and say that this supports / does not support the hypotheses – and some of the significant results in the data (e.g. the typicality effect for F2 on /y/) are likely simply a consequence of running so many separate tests.",Linear mixed effects models are appropriate for the research questions & this type of data.,"While many of the variables were clearly justified, some of them were not (see my comments about F1/F2 above); and no justification is provided for the model structures. It's also not entirely clear at what level the vowel spaces were calculated – within each speaker for each typicality condition? This should be described explicitly.","By and large, the variables are suitable for addressing the main research questions.","There are severe problems with the random effects structures for most of the models here. The word duration analysis does not include any random effects by item, and also does not include random slopes over typicality by speaker, which is problematic & could lead to anti-conservative results. Not knowing exactly what the observations are for the vowel space model, it's hard to say whether the model structure is appropriate here, but it is possible that the same key random slope is also missing here. The F1/F2 analyses also do not include this random slope, which is problematic for the same reasons outlined above.

Also, the large overall number of statistical tests in the report makes it hard to evaluate them in light of the research questions. For instance, the authors find a significant F2 different for the vowel /y/ across two typicality conditions at time point 4 – what should we make of this finding? They seem to essentially dismiss it, but then why was it included in the first place? There are close to 50 statistical tests in the report that speak to the main hypotheses, which is simply too much! Find two significant effects here (as the authors do) is essentially meaningless, given the high probability of false positives.","If there were exclusions, they were not clearly described.","The only transformation worth mentioning here is the vowel space area calculation used by the authors. This transformation, though interesting, really ought to have been described in more detail.",NA,1
