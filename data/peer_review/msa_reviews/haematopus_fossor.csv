haematopus_fossor,65,70,70,publishable with minor revision.,"This analysis reports multiple tests of three different phonetic metrics without providing a convincing rationale for this decision. In addition, some factors potentially affecting the outcome of the analysis were not appropriately controlled for, including speech rate (which directly affects duration measures) and inter-speaker variation (especially, given that random slopes were not included in the statistical model).",The statistical analysis type (LMER) seems correctly selected to me.,"The metrics selected for the response variables are potentially interesting, but the authors reported a bunch of them, and no motivation was provided for the big quantity of tests. This makes the analysis feel a bit like a “fishing expedition”, with multiple selected metrics and multiple testings of them, and no correction of the resulting p-values. The tests include frame duration, adjective duration, noun duration, adj V duration, noun V duration, adj V intensity, noun V intensity, adj V centralisation, and noun V centralisation, for a total of 9 tests.","The authors chose to report duration, but they did not normalize/control for speech rate, so that the variable duration, as is, might not be adequate.","The models are structured as METRIC.c ~ trial * typicality + (1 | word) + (1 | speaker), but the reasoning behind choosing to add an interaction over non-interacting predictors is not provided. Random intercepts for “speaker” and “word” were appropriately added. I assume that the inclusion of random slopes prevented the model from converging and that they were discarded because of that.",I feel that not enough subsets of the data were excluded. Our team needed to mark extra sentences as errors or hesitation breaks in addition to the ones already marked as such in the provided textgrids. Errors and hesitation stops likely affected the measurements (e.g. duration) in these sentences.,"All measurements were centered around the mean of the population. Given that “speaker” was only introduced as a random intercept in the statistical analysis, I would have opted for a by-speaker normalization to account for inter-speaker variation to a greater extent.",-,2
haematopus_fossor,80,80,80,publishable with minor revision.,"We like that the authors chose to include several different dependent variables for their analysis, and also their attention to individual variation (as depicted in graphs) was appreciated.

It is somewhat unclear how the authors reached the conclusion that there is no strong evidence for an effect of typicality on speech production -- even though we agree that no strong evidence was found in the reported analyses. After all, they report one or two significant differences (albeit with p-values relatively close to .05).

On a related note, there does not seem to be any correction made for the evaluation of multiple different models to test the same hypothesis (e.g., FDR or Bonferroni). If such corrections were made, the conclusion that there is no strong evidence for an (overall) effect of typicality would gain more support.

Interestingly, one of the significant effects is in the opposite direction to what we would predict (typical adjectives being longer). Could that be a ""sign-error"", in Gelman's terms?","The LME model is suitable for the task at hand. (We used the same model.)
","It is not entirely clear why certain dependent variables are chosen (although most do make intuitve sense); we are also not entirely sure why two analyses were conducted, with two levels of typicality each.",See previous comment.,Structure strikes us as suitable (module earlier comments),"The authors note that “This hand-correction was only carried out for target trials, i.e.trials in the NF condition. Trials marked with “error” or “hesitation break” in the notes tier were not corrected and were excluded from further analysis.” This makes sense, but we should note that typicality data can be derived for the other conditions as well (not just NF).","The transformations that are applied (e.g., centering) are common practice.","The segmentation process is explained very clearly. We appreciate the fact that the authors manually corrected the forced alignments, and carried out a reliability analysis of their corrections. It is good that they also included instructions for each annotator.",2
haematopus_fossor,85,85,85,publishable with minor revision.,"The analysis consisted of 8 acoustic variables: frame duration (from onset of utterance to onset of adjective), adjective duration, noun duration, adjective stressed vowel duration, noun stressed vowel duration, noun vowel intensity, adjective vowel [F1-F2] centralization, and noun vowel [F1-F2] centralization. We had understood that each team should have tackled only one response variables, but in this case a total of eight statistical models, one for each acoustic variable, were fitted. The acoustic variables chosen and the statistical models used are appropriate.","A total of 8 linear mixed-effects regression models, one for each acoustic variable, were fitted. Variables were centered. Effect sizes were said to be calculated by pseudo-standardising the coeﬀicients, but there results were not reported. Typicality, a variable with three levels, was helmert-coded. The models therefore carry out two comparisons: one between the typical trials to the mean of the medium and atypical trials, and one between the medium and atypical trials. The choices are appropriate.","Fixed effects were typicality, trial number, and their interaction. Random variables were varying intercept for participant and random intercept of word. No random slope was included (perhaps for convergence issues?).",Condition was not included because the analysis used only the NF condition (perhaps because of the lack of no full crossing of variables in the data).,"Models were fitted and reported adequately, though a total of eight models were fitted and reported. Most of them yielded non-significant results. And significant results arouse, their were mild. In some results, there seems to be an apparent emphasis for the typical combinations (longer stressed vowel of adjectives, and more peripheral vowels), but no explanation is given.","Data was force-aligned, and hand-corrected only for target trials in the NF condition. Trials marked with “error” or “hesitation break” in the notes tier were not corrected and were excluded from further analysis. Decisions are appropriate.","No transformation was done, and perhaps using relative durations instead of raw durations could have eliminated a possible effect of speech rate.","Answer to the main research question was of no evidence for an effect of typicality on speech production in this experiment, which is similar to our own results and to the other two already reviewed.",2
haematopus_fossor,93,94,93,publishable with major revision.,Good with some points needed to be clarified.,Good,Good,Good,Good,Good,The vowel centralization part should be excluded! There is no point of having this part in the analysis.,"'- The plots plots should be commented (see, for instance, Gerke, 2020, G Reporting Standards for a Bland–Altman Agreement Analysis: A Review of Methodological Reviews.
- Additionally, both adjective duration and adjective vowel duration showed an effect of typicality, but what were the adjectives again? Is there any reason this may be due to the number of syllables in the word or some other factor, such as vowel quality? Low vowels tend to have longer durations than high vowels simply because it takes time to open the mouth farther.
- In regards to vowel intensity, in general  it doesn't vary much and is more dependent on phrase position, as intensity drops throughout an utterance. Sharf (1966) shows that intensity doesn't correlate with vowel opening, so this also doesn't go with their centralization argument either.
- It is really hard to tell anything from the plot on page 3, plus these are obviously non-normalized measurements and so it's hard to really see some vowel spaces, like that of participant TB.
