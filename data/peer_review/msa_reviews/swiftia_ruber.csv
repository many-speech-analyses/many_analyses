swiftia_ruber,95,100,95,publishable with minor revision.,The analysis was very good.,The choice was very good.,"One thing they don't address is the (very frequent) reduced speech, which altered the syllable count. This will change their sw#sw pattern and must be addressed. Did they exclude these tokens? Did they get parsed as if they were sw#sw patterns when they were s#sw (or something else) instead? Also there was no discussion of how they treated hesitation breaks/pauses, which may disrupt the sw#sw pattern. Ultimately we don't think it will change the analysis, but it is an issue.","They excluded (or they're missing) speaker PS for unknown reasons. They didn't mention what they did with ""error""-marked trials.",Very good.,Very good.,Scaling of pitch f0 was very good.,Minor typos (totalling 348 typical and 348 typical phrases).,2
swiftia_ruber,75,75,75,publishable with minor revision.,"The analysis was well done in general, but it did seem slightly forced given the original structure of the data. It is understandable why data had to be excluded to fit the analysis decision, but it unfortunately left a very small number of items that makes conclusions slightly less generalizable that it would have otherwise been.

If these results were to be replicated, more items would be required and time points along an entire pitch contour would be preferable (although this would require sentences to be composed of sonorants.)

As the main research question was concerned with the NF condition, we will limit our comments to typical and atypical conditions within that condition.","Fo modelling pitch contours, the use of B-splines is entirely appropriate. It was unclear why they were modelled as two separate models (for the NF conditions), although we profess that we are unsure whether or not this needs to be the case in brms. In other packages (e.g., mgcv), these curves would have been fit in the same models as a by-factor smooth and the addition of random effects would have had the advantage of partial pooling.",N/A,"Plotting the fundamental frequency over time was appropriate, although controlling for changes in experimental time (trial) may have also been appropriate.","The structure of the model seems appropriate, although it is generally better to fit the data in a single model to take advantage of partial pooling. We understand the computation time issue, but the authors should note that committing pseudo-replication makes us overconfident in conclusions that we draw. There was no difference in this instance, however (we fit a different b-spline model using penalized maximum likelihood with maximal random effects and the interpretation was similar.)","It was unfortunate that the majority of items were excluded, and it would have been nice to see an analysis that took advantage of more of the data. Based on the analysis chosen, however, the exclusion seems appropriate and necessary.",The data seem to have been transformed in the appropriate way to facilitate comparison across speakers.,NA,2
swiftia_ruber,50,60,55,publishable with major revision.,"The contour plots in figure 1 through 3 look a bit strange, for example, F0 of stressed segments in both conditions in figure 2 appear to be lower than the unstressed segments. This indicates that there might be an error in the measurements. Upon inspecting the TextGrid, it turns out that the syllable boundaries were not well aligned with the syllable structure of the adjectives and nouns: the consonant onsets were included in the previous syllable rather than the current syllable, which should be at least explained in more detail so that the plots can be better interpreted. The results are mostly qualitative, which is fine, but it would be better to still report the statistics and discuss why the difference shown in figure 1 doesn't seem to matter much in speech.",The statistical analysis method seems to be appropriate.,"The authors did not explain why a Gaussian assumption was used for both the basis expansion and prior, and why 5 points were selected per segment.",The authors did not include speaker/item random effects in their model. This can be especially problematic because their F0 normalization is per utterance based.,The method the authors chose to use seems to be appropriate.,The authors did not exclude potential F0 measurement errors such as F0 irregularities caused by creaky voice.,"It is not clear why normalizing F0 with regard to the median of the F0 contour is sufficient for cross speaker comparison, as the normalization baseline can vary within an individual speaker due to unobserved effects on each utterance. So the resulted unit is per utterance based, which can work but should be conditioned on speaker. It's probably better to choose the median F0 of each speaker as the baseline so that the normalized unit can be compared and interpret across speakers.",NA,1
swiftia_ruber,70,70,70,publishable with major revision.,"Bayesian modeling is informative; however, they mentioned that they took out random variables because of the computational load of the model and because the splines of the first model did not differ when the variables were included versus when they were not. However, this seems like the random variables should have been included in all models for the most thorough analysis. At the very least, I think a basic regression model could have been computed to show any effects of random variables. 

Another concern is how representative the data they analyzed are, and how could the pattern be generalized (See below for more detailed concerns). I'd also like to know more detail about vowel segmenting criterion, how many data points for each condition they are analyzing, especially for the typical/atypical phrases under the NF condition, and whether the difference in figure 1 is statistically significant.",Analysis seems appropriate with above caveats,See above comments,See above comments,See above comments,"They excluded the medium typicality category, which limited the amount of data analyzed and (as they mentioned) made their distribution uneven. I think they could have at least done some analyses within the medium typicality subset (just as they did with the other subsets, e.g. AF vs NF conditions within the atypical phrases) instead of leaving it completely out.",Data transformations are appropriate,NA,1
