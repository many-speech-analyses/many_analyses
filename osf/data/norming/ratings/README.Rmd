# Overview

Here you can find an aggregated dataset with the typicality judgement for each of the images in `norming/images/`, for each participant.

The `tipicality.csv` file has the following columns:

- `prolific id`: The participant/trial id.
- `object`: The name of the object represented in the image.
- `typicality`: The typicality rating (numeric, `1-100`, `1` = most atypical, `100` = most typical).
- `colour`: The color of the object in the image.
